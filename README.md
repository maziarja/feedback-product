## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Filter suggestions by category
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
- Upvote product feedback requests
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

While building this project, I learned how intercepting routes work in Next.js and how powerful they become when combined with parallel routes â€” especially for displaying modals smoothly without breaking page navigation.

I also discovered the strength of using **Zod** with **React Hook Form** for validating and managing forms. Together, they made handling form inputs much more reliable, readable, and efficient.

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my appreciation to **Tom Phillips** for his _NextAuth v5_ course on Udemy. I had learned authentication before, but it was always a bit confusing to me. After taking his course, the concepts became much clearer and more structured.
